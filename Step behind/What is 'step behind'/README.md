# What is "Step behind"?

There are many ways to explane "Step behind".

Maybe you think "Step behind" means losing. Maybe it means almost winning.

There are so many meanings behind the word, but to me, both of these explanations are not exactly right.


In the past, I thought "step behind" meant **not enough effort**.

In a game, the one who reaches the finish line won't be called "Step behind". In school, the one who has done his homework won't tell you he is still one "Step behind".

Although the second is good, I still want to be the top. 

I believe that everyone has the same experience.

So many frustrating things have happened in our lives. Encountering these disappointing things drives me crazy.

The anger is a flame, a flame wants to burn the winner down. Pretending my weakness is the winner's fault.

After anger and rage, I always feel depressed. It feels like dropping into the deepest abbeys.

Until now, I still remember the pain and suffer from it, but I found a way to release it.Sharing my experience can make me think positively, so I decided to build this website and tell you guys my stories.
